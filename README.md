# ROS Path Planning

**Robot Motion planning** is a computational problem that involves finding a sequence of valid configurations to move the robot from the source to the destination. Generally, it includes **Path Searching** and **Trajectory Optimization**.

* **Path Searching**: Based on path constraints (e.g., avoiding obstacles), to find the optimal sequence for the robot to travel from the source to the destination without collision.

* **Trajectory Optimization**: Based on kinematics, dynamics and obstacles, to optimize the trajectory of the motion state from the source to the destination according to the path.

*Tested on ubuntu 20.04 LTS with ROS Noetic.*

1. Install [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (Desktop-Full Install *Recommended*).

2. Install git.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

3. Install dependence

    - conan

        ```bash
        pip install conan==1.59.0
        conan remote add conancenter https://center.conan.io
        ```

    - Other dependence.

        ```bash
        sudo apt install python-is-python3 \
        ros-noetic-amcl \
        ros-noetic-base-local-planner \
        ros-noetic-map-server \
        ros-noetic-move-base \
        ros-noetic-navfn \
        libgoogle-glog-dev
        ```

4. Clone the reposity.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrhuch1/path-planning.git
    ```

5. Compile the code.
   
   **NOTE: Please refer to [#48](https://github.com/ai-winter/ros_motion_planning/issues/48) if you meet libignition dependency error.**

    ```bash
    cd scripts/
    ./build.sh  # you may need to install catkin-tools using: sudo apt install python-catkin-tools
    ```

6. Execute the code.

    ```bash
    cd scripts/
    ./main.sh
    ```

    > NOTE: Modifying launch files may not have any effect, because they are regenerated by a Python script based on `src/user_config/user_config.yaml` when you run `main.sh`. Therefore, you should modify configurations in `user_config.yaml` instead of launch files.

7. Use **2D Nav Goal** in RViz to select the goal.
