# ROS Path Planning

**Robot Motion planning** is a computational problem that involves finding a sequence of valid configurations to move the robot from the source to the destination. Generally, it includes **Path Searching** and **Trajectory Optimization**.

* **Path Searching**: Based on path constraints (e.g., avoiding obstacles), to find the optimal sequence for the robot to travel from the source to the destination without collision.

* **Trajectory Optimization**: Based on kinematics, dynamics and obstacles, to optimize the trajectory of the motion state from the source to the destination according to the path.
